You are a writer what does writing do for you as a designer like what does that sort of tap into me as a designer things english hold myself accountable for some of the processes that I'm thinking through for documenting with regards to understanding how to build connections and relationships and what I mean by that is something like introducing yourself to a perspective on growing as is introverted and what that meant understanding that I can rate these things down look at them reflect learn from them and sometimes I almost think of writing as does another version of design in terms of like getting all can use for share writing as another version of design I like that I like that I was explaining to someone recently about they had asked me when was the last time that I had designed something because I mean people know that I do this show and then like for my actual day job I also kind of do some work dabbing an audio even though I'm a creative strategist and they just the last time you design something and I got what they meant they meant when was the last time you sort of I guess sat down in designed something but I told him that like a lot of what I do now these days is more along sort of Designing processes and designing systems and I do a fair amount of writing as well and I don't know how many designers would consider writing as an element of design but it totally is it absolutely is yes how this is put together come that work in the space of artifact experimenting lens as well how do you think we can encourage more designers specifically more black designers me to write as a black designer is the importance and impact of my voice to everything else that is also out there and what I mean by that is as an industry there are specifically which tends to be the majority a cIS white heter Mill perspective and that is one perspective and I found that in many situations I'm unable to find that material fully helpful by adding my own voice it really gives a different perspective I hold myself accountable to that perspective to say here is my Approach the things that I would consider and I encourage other folk to share that they feel best identify with their everyone I'm talking to designers and trying to impart the importance of writing I try to to show it to them design section like a year but I'm sure there is an Arts and Design section exists books and will probably notice that most of the books there are not by or from people of color like the important I see to riding is to put your own words out there to be a part of the historical design book it could be an article a series of Articles it could be from your head into a medium that I've enjoyed and I think writing certainly is one way to do that and I think a big way to really spread your words out there more so people can know what it is that you think and what you feel and like the thoughts behind the work that you do or even just the thoughts about this industry I see how many people riding up a storm about stuff on Twitter I am a very Twitter user I really kind of only use it as a highlight reel and I try to save all the stuff that I really want to sort of get out there either I make it into a presentation I'll talk about in the show or I'll write about it and I feel like that way my words can sort of live longer to sweets are such an ephemeral thing you know sense of that your words carry weight your words are your thoughts you know in this other form and it's a way that it can sort of live on past whatever experiences you might have or anything of that nature and it can be just sort of a historical reference in many ways just looking to write about black designers and found such limited material on the surface level and there was definitely material on the surface level of like a half hour Google search there was was like okay so this is not something that is easily accessible how can it become more accessible I absolutely hear you know design mentors or anyone that have really helped you out along your way I have been really fortunate to have some great folks along the way when I was doing a lot of consultancy work there was a creative director named John Hurt who really at the time continue to create space for me to just grow and advocated for me to lead on different projects when I was much younger and working in an agency space there was a professor of mine who was then also our creative director Terry Coppell who influenced an impacted my career trajectory and then a lot of the Nom design folk and what I made by that are community members with regards to folks who work within the community of design and that can be folks in research folks really in creating Community spaces and then a lot of my peers I would say have been mentors probably in that actively and I don't know if they would give themselves those titles but a lot of my parents have pushed away so much advice insights Clarity and just space for me to ask questions as well again I have been thinking about writing a book and maybe piecing together the concept of writing a book a couple of topics that come to mind are that connection between the Natural Sciences and design organizations I'm also very interested in sharing about the experiences my own experiences within the design industry when there is I feel the time and space to put that together and I'm also really interested in about design of that can you I don't know dive into that a little more about design education cuz you are decided yourself like what would you want to sort of explore there design education in New York in my own experience that I've had I can't speak to other experiences but to my own experience has been very good and there has been so much Erasure of the work of other folks who are not eurocentric and without the eurocentric lens and what that means is that a lot of work and a lot of the things that I exper ienced was i used to really be swiss design aesthetic I went to work was that really nature Church from the perspective like that was all I was told yet when I brought about a different design style that was much more colorful and that wasn't gratified by my I realized part of that education is cuz we're so limited because like the most important design and that just Norms into the industry into how we consider what good versus bad work is and I put those in quotes cuz that like it's just a simple marriage bad also really understanding how that impacts all the way up to who gets hired who get s at why is it that design school is so expensive and that the cost for entry is so high what happens to folks who don't have the access but have every interest in skill set and just get wanting to dig into that a little deeper I mean I would love to read a book about that and certainly you know it's an interesting reflection on how now they're really starting to bring in other sources to I want to use the word de:ize on it because that's the word that sort of has been attached to these conversations but they're really I think diversifying their sources of just like where other students can learn about design and it's not just from style or German style and a lot of these are like events there are conferences there so much stuff now I mean honestly even from before when I started this podcast there's so many more events and opportunities and ways to learn about the history of black people in design now than there were 10 years ago it's amazing and I really want to see where it goes from here I believe that it's really beginning to open up just so many different perspectives with regards to also who teaches design also to your point how we learn about design so from your podcast to events like where all the black designers to various slack groups that have come up to just how there are these micro communities even through social media as well where folks are asking conference about also there is the business side of it we're hand in hand with all of the Civic unrest and the specificity of the murder of that how all the sudden everyone's like over being held accountable as companies and everyone's looking at your board of directors and I can't speak forever okay how are these companies because what a lot of folks are asking for too for themselves in the end I know when that you know unfortunately when this murder occurred last year how that one really drove people out into the streets to protest but it was amazing how people were calling on companies because companies were doing this thing where the black squares and saying they stand for racial Justice and everyone else like but what about in your industry or like what about a decision so you had so many people that were starting to sort of turn around and say well if you're really committed then why does the industry look like this why does the industry function in this way like what are the real steps that you're taking besides just posting a black Square you know I know last year there were a lot of companies that were saying yes we're going to make this a day off and and you know we're going to start to observe it I guess maybe they'll observe it on Friday now so three day weekend asking for but probably just more so in priv ate conversations have so much more room for these conference publicly not always but just a little bit more and really understanding and also learning what's best for folks are there there's pros and cons for our so many aspects what are the ways in which you can help folks yeah when you look at where you're at now is this how you imagine yourself when you were a kid of myself in some way of doing something creative but I would not have imagined the ability to or just the immediate yeah the immediate ability to lead a team to work through teams to run my own business I don't think I would have necessarily imagine this but probably felt like I could try different things anyway at this point just words you're writing and everything how do you now define success as a few things the ability to make decisions that I feel much more confident about I would define success as the impact of continuing to advocate for others and continue to make space for a community work I would define success as recognition and understanding of my time and value and not settling as well and I define success as being able to set boundaries and be able to say no to things as well I would like to be working on projects that care just continues to care about people in the future whether that's through arvr sound design interactions there I think in five years mediums and tools that we use will be able to be a strategic partner for those things I I could see myself going back to running my own business isn't something that I do roy and for continue to just partnering in the education space as well and always being able to make a bridge to continue to increase access well just the wrap things up here where can our audience find out more about you and about your work and everything online or on Twitter at Sabrina Hall NYC sounds good well Sabrina Hall I want to thank you so much for coming on the show one for just sharing your story and and talking about the work that you're doing but also you know really impressing upon you know I think not just me but I'll still the audience like the importance of writing the importance of really also just like checking in with yourself being able to accept those boundaries and using that work to of course make yourself better and to make you know your community better so thank you so much for coming on the show I appreciate it for having me
